# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview: 
Pewlett Hackard is a large company which employs tens of thousands of people. This client is curious to know how many people will soon be retiring in order to properly plan for onboarding of new individuals in new roles. We’ve been tasked with identifying how many people will soon retire, sort by job title, and identify who is eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

## Results: 
* Impending Retirement Count: 90,398 will be retiring in the next few years which will require a significant knowledge transfer.
* Engineers alone make up almost half of the total individuals likely to retire soon when you group together the titles of Senior Engineer, Engineer, and Assistant Engineer. It should be considered a priority for management as the first department to begin the mentorship program. 
* There’s definitely room to dig further and pull out better information by departments than what we have done for the challenge. We have sorted by job title, but many people are labeled as staff or senior staff which doesn’t give us much to go on. We could further join and sort the tables to include department information to give us a stronger idea of how each department will be impacted. 
* Over half of retirement count are individuals eligible for a mentorship program, though I’m honestly not clear on how the company arrived at its criteria of those born in 1965. Surely this eligibility could be refined and expanded beyond an arbitrary birth year. It would make sense to match those who are due to retire in the next 5 years to be matched with their direct report employees to begin a mentorship program that ensures knowledge transfer is maintained. 

## Summary: 
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? **90,398**
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees? Yes, though each mentor will need to mentor roughly 2 individuals to cover all the vacancies. 

**Recommended Tables:** 
1. The number of retirement age employees by Department, then broken down by title. 
2. A table which shows the total employees in each department, those due to retire, and a ratio column to get a better sense of which departments are the most outmatched.
